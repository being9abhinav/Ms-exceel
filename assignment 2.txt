Ans. Excel perform the operation by following the PEMDAS rules.
     Excel will calculate anything in parentheses first.

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
   for any of two?
Ans. The top function according to me are as below:
		1. SUM():-It usually aggregates values from a selection of columns or rows from our selected range.
                      SYNTAX:-
                             =SUM(number1, [number2], …)
		
		2. AVERAGE():-The average function is an extremely useful tool for getting the average value in a range of cells.
                          SYNTAX:-
                              “AVERAGE” (number1, number2, etc.).

            3. COUNT():-The COUNT function counts all cells in a given range that contain only numeric values.
                       SYNTAX:-  
                       =COUNT(value1, [value2], …)
		
		4. TEXT():-Text function is a useful tool that helps convert a date (or number) into a text string in a particular format.
                       SYNTAX:-
                             “=TEXT” (value, format_text).
         
            5. VLOOKUP():-The VLOOKUP function searches for a specific value in a dataset.
                          If it finds it, it returns another value from a different column in the same row.
                          SYNTAX:-
                               “=VLOOKUP” (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, *range_lookup*).

5. When would you use the subtotal function?
Ans. The Excel SUBTOTAL function returns an aggregate calculation for supplied values. 
     Despite the name, SUBTOTAL can perform a variety of calculations, including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and others.

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
Ans. SYNTAX:-
                               “=VLOOKUP” (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, *range_lookup*).
		“lookup_value” is the data you want to find.
		“table_array” is the data column where you want to limit your search.
		“col_index_num” is the column number within the table that you want to return a value from.
		“range_lookup” is an optional argument that allows you to search for the exact match of your lookup value without sorting the table.
